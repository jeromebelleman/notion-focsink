Focus sink, a simple-minded focus stealing prevention.

This enables you to manually, quickly and temporarily mark a frame as focus
sink so all new windows go to it. It's particularly useful when you start
a program which takes some time to open its window(s), so you can carry on
working on something else in the meantime without the new windows popping
up later on in the current frame you're working on.
